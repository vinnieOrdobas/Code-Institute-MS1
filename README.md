### UX

Doug's Club website aims at a broader community, targeting people from diverse backgrounds and with small-time frames. A simple layout with an uncomplicated way to sign-up for the service and book classes is key. The focus is to direct people to the gym.

---

#### 1. Strategy

> The goal of this endeavor is to offer a service which will improve general well-being and help users to choose a healthier lifestyle.
>
> ##### Project Goals:
>
> - Offer a simple and fast way to sign-up for the service, to book classes and interact with the community.
>
> - Increase the perception of how a healthy lifestyle can improve general well-being.
>
> - Enlarge member's database through social media.
>
> ##### Customer Goals:
>
> - Enhanced UX design through mobile-first approach.
> - Clear and concise content, simple interaction with the system to attain a quick yet efficient visit.
> - Learn about the infrastructure of the club and its class framework through visual content.
> - Footer supplying links to Social Media.
> - Effortless sign-up service.
> - Navigation bar for a smoother navigation.
> - Diminished time to load the page and content, in order to speed up the experience.
> - Book classes on-the-fly.

#### 2. Scope

> The focus here is to achieve a version of the website with just enough features to be usable - the concept of Minimum viable product (MVP), that contains:
>
> - Catalog with pictures depicting the amenities of the club.
> - Map location of the club.
> - Sign-up form.
> - Straightforward UX for the users.
> - Features that match my current knowledge.
#### 3. Structure

> On the structure plan, the effort was concentrated on prompting the user to quickly understand the layout of the page and find the content easily digestible - hence the content is structured on a bite-size framework. 
> The gallery presents pictures of the club and are organised in a simple slide show widget with a brief description of the room → navigation bar intends to improve the returning user's experience.

#### 4. Skeleton

> - [Wire frames](assets/docs/wireframes.pdf): One-page website with five sections
>
> - Home, About, Gallery, Crew and Sign-Up/Contact sections.
>
> - Navigation bar - Links to each section with a sign-in option.
>
> - Footer with social media link and copyrights.

#### 5. Surface

Through some research, I've found that Gym websites praise contrast between colour palettes, so I've picked darker tones in contrast with brighter colors, albeit with darker tonalities.

> ##### Colours
>
> Darker graphite tonalities, black-and-white hero image in contrast with brighter tones - to make components "jump" and to mimic movement. 
> - I've picked a bright, deep ocean blue(#003049) for one of the background-wrappers and a leafy green(#003049) for the other. 
> - For body text, I've used a combination of regular black, white smoke for the bright text. For the button togglers and the text the jumbo tron, I've chosen a darker "blood-red" (#AE3A21)
> 
> ##### Typography
>
> - "TEKO" font (with fall-back font of Sans-Serif) for main headings. This font was picked for its hard angles, to create a stronger contrast with "background-colours".
> - "Roboto" font (with fall-back font of Sans-Serif) for body content.
>
> ##### Images
>
> The images are a representation of what a GYM would have for infrastructure, as a way for customers to see it before visiting the club.

### Bugs and turnarounds

> - The "Crew" section had aligning issues with lack of structure. The way around was to use a code snippet I found on [WrapPixel](https://snippets.wrappixel.com/bootstrap-our-team-section/) and change the structure slightly.
> - Faced issues with spacing the rounded-pictures for the crew section. Wrapped the content in bootstrap class with flex box properties to space them out evenly.
> - Meet the crew section had issues with image size for different devices - the rounded pictures were to big for smaller devices. Found the solution on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29641526/how-can-images-be-resized-using-bootstrap#:~:text=Use%20class%3D%22img%2Dresponsive,Its%20a%20bootstrap%20class).
> - Rounded pictures had different sizes, which was pushing the subtitle and the description of each member to different places.
> - Had issues to push the social media links in the footer section to the right. Wrapped the content in a bootstrap class container which uses flex box technology to horizontally align content to the right.
> - Footer section had issues on mobile devices, as the sizing would get scrambled. Fixed by wrapping in a container only visible on medium screens and above, and created another one only for smaller screens.
> - Carousel was aligning to the left side of the page, used bootstrap class with flex box properties to create space around the gallery and centralize it.
> - Carousel rendered too small for mobile phones, which led me to choose a different type of gallery(static) for smaller devices.
> - Carousel images on desktop were too wide and big, which led me to wrap the around another container to keep it consistent and easier to navigate through them.
> - On the find us section, I had issues with embedding the map. I followed the tutorial found on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/UqXeX1Irv5o) - How to Make a Responsive Google Map Embed with CSS (EASY), by garnatti one.
> - In order to align the content in one section, I wrapped the Google maps snippet and the find us content in a card deck.
